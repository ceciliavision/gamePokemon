It’s a simple snake game, but with the ‘food’ being Pikachu and the ‘snake’ being a Pokeball; and the environment is a fancy village with houses, trees, a cart and a sun that changes lighting of the scene. Our Pokeball increases one when encountering a Pikachu, and decreases one when encountering a Miaouss. The Pokeball dies whenever it hits a house or a tree.
